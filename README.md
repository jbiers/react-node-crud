A simple CRUD application built with React and NodeJS

I've been learning web development for about six months now. I've gotten to the point of landing a job as a Frontend Developer to a startup and becoming pretty proficient at building React applications. But... that's about it. I have very little undestanding of backend development at this point, and want to fix that.

I started by watching a few courses online but they feel pretty boring and I am not sure that is the best way to learn. So, I've decided to follow the advice of Fabio Akito in his video [FABIO AKITA VIDEO] and jump right into the thing.

First, I've forked a simple CRUD app on github which uses the technologies I want to use in mine.

- Create React App. How does it work??
